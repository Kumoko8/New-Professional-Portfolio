  ## Description

 
     This project is designed to use React to build a site that showcases our projects and experiences. I learned a lot about how React uses state to update the virtual DOM with then changes the DOM, the file structure for React and how to apply the header and footer and styling to all pages, how to create components that can be reused in any page and how to deploy the page so that it updates with GitHub.
