                Thank you for visiting my page. Featured are some of my best and most enjoyable applications
                from my time in bootcamp and beyond. I first got into the tech field because of my interest in the intersection of
                technology, design, and education. I am passionate about using software development to create web services that make
                learning and communication more effective, enjoyable, and aesthetically pleasing.
